    "2. Which type of Programming does Python support? \n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including:\n",
    "1.Procedural programming: Python allows you to write programs using procedural programming techniques, where you break down a program into smaller procedures or functions.\n",
    "2.Object-oriented programming (OOP): Python has extensive support for object-oriented programming. It provides classes, objects, inheritance, and other OOP concepts to help structure and organize code.\n",
    "3.Functional programming: Python supports functional programming concepts such as higher-order functions, lambda functions, and the ability to treat functions as first-class objects.\n",
    "4.Imperative programming: Python allows you to write programs that specify the sequence of statements to be executed, modifying the program state along the way.\n"

    "3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers? \n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "Yes, Python is case sensitive when dealing with identifiers. In Python, identifiers refer to names used for variables, functions, classes, modules, or any other object. Python treats uppercase and lowercase letters as distinct characters, so using different cases in identifiers will create different names."

    "4. What is the correct extension of the Python file? \n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "    The correct extension for a Python file is \".py\". When saving a Python script or module, it is recommended to use the .py extension at the end of the file name. This convention helps in identifying the file as a Python source code file.\n",
    "For example, if you have a Python script called \"my_script.py,\" the \".py\" extension indicates that it contains Python code. This is not strictly enforced by the Python language itself, but following this convention makes it easier for developers and tools to recognize and work with Python files."

    "5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted? \n",
    "ANSWER:\n",
    "    Python code is interpreted rather than compiled. When you run a Python program, the Python interpreter reads and executes the code line by line, converting it into bytecode instructions that are then executed. This interpretation process happens at runtime, without the need for a separate compilation step.\n",
    "However, behind the scenes, Python does perform some level of compilation. When a Python script is executed, it is first compiled into bytecode, which is a lower-level representation of the code. This bytecode is then interpreted and executed by the Python interpreter.\n",
