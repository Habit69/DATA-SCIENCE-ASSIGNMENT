    "Deadlocks and race conditions are two common synchronization issues that can occur in multithreaded programs.\n",
    "Deadlocks : A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked, waiting for each other to release a resource. In other words, each thread is holding a resource that the other thread needs to proceed, but neither thread can release its resource until it acquires the resource it is waiting for. This results in a situation where both threads are stuck, waiting indefinitely for the other thread to release the resource. Deadlocks can cause a program to hang or crash and are notoriously difficult to debug.\n",
    "Race Condition : A race condition occurs when two or more threads access a shared resource simultaneously, and the final outcome depends on the order in which the threads are executed. In other words, the execution of the program depends on the timing of the threads, and if the order of execution is not controlled, it can result in unpredictable behavior. For example, if two threads try to update the same variable simultaneously, the final value of the variable will depend on which thread executed first. This can result in incorrect program behavior, such as data corruption or inconsistency.\n",
    "To avoid deadlocks and race conditions, it is important to ensure that the threads access shared resources in a thread-safe manner. This can be achieved using synchronization mechanisms such as locks, semaphores, and mutexes, which allow only one thread to access a shared resource at a time. It is also important to design multithreaded programs carefully, avoiding shared resources wherever possible, and minimizing the time that a thread holds a lock to prevent deadlocks. Additionally, techniques such as thread prioritization and thread scheduling can be used to control the order of execution and avoid race conditions."
