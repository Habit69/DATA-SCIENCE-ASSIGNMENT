    "Answer:\n",
    "   1.) The Exception class is used as the base class for custom exceptions in Python because it provides a standard way of representing and handling errors that occur in a program. When you create a custom exception class, it should inherit from the Exception class in order to be recognized as an exception by the Python runtime.\n",
    "   2.)By inheriting from the Exception class, your custom exception class automatically gets all the properties and methods of the Exception class, making it easier to use and handle in your code. For example, you can raise your custom exception using the raise statement, and it will be caught by a try-except block just like any other standard exception.\n",
    "   3.)Additionally, inheriting from the Exception class also makes it possible for other parts of your code to catch your custom exception specifically, if necessary. This allows you to create more specific error handling logic for your custom exceptions, rather than relying on a catch-all approach for all exceptions.\n",
    "   4.)In summary, using the Exception class as the base class for custom exceptions provides a standard way of representing and handling errors in Python, making it easier to integrate custom exceptions into your code and handle them appropriately"

    "Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.)Be specific in catching exceptions: Instead of catching a broad, generic exception such as Exception, it's better to catch more specific exceptions that correspond to the errors you expect to handle. This way, you can ensure that only the errors you want to handle are caught and other unexpected errors are allowed to propagate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.)Use try-except blocks: try-except blocks are the recommended way to handle exceptions in Python. They allow you to catch exceptions and take appropriate action, without letting the program crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.)Provide meaningful error messages: When raising exceptions, provide meaningful error messages that can help you diagnose and fix the problem. Avoid using generic error messages like \"Something went wrong\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4.)Avoid using bare except blocks: Bare except blocks catch all exceptions and can hide important information about the cause of the error. Instead, use specific exception classes or Exception with a more descriptive error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.)Use finally blocks wisely: finally blocks are used to execute code that needs to run regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. Use them wisely to clean up resources or close files, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.)Don't suppress exceptions: Avoid suppressing exceptions by using a bare except block or catching a broad exception class and not re-raising it. Doing so can hide important information about the cause of the error and make it harder to diagnose and fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.)Propagate exceptions up the call stack: If you catch an exception and cannot handle it, propagate it up the call stack by re-raising it. This way, the exception can be handled by an enclosing try-except block or reach the top-level of the program where it can be logged or displayed to the user"
